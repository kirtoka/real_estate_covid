## ‚öõ Process
For the development of this project we will be using the CRISP-DM methodology, which include the following stages. 
 - Business Understanding 
 - Data Understanding 
 - Prepare Data 
 - Data Modeling 
 - Evaluate the Results 
 - Deploy

What are the best states to invest in real estate?
Is Now a Good Time to Buy a House?
Which feature has more effect in increasing the price of the house?

## ‚õ≥ Installation
Libraries required:
- Python 3

 - Median Listing Price	 -  The median listing price within the specified geography during the specified month.
 - Median Listing Price M/M	 - The percentage change in the median listing price from the previous month.
 - Median Listing Price Y/Y	 - The percentage change in the median listing price from the same month in the previous year.
 - Active Listing Count	 - The count of active listings within the specified geography during the specified month. The active listing count tracks the number of for sale properties on the market, excluding pending listings where a pending status is available.

 - Price Increase Count Y/Y	- The percentage change in the price increase count from the same month in the previous year.
 - Price Decrease Count	- The count of listings which have had their price reduced within the specified geography. The price decrease count represents a typical week‚Äôs worth of listings which have had their price reduced in a given month. The price decrease count can be multiplied by the number of weeks in a month to produce a monthly price decrease count.
 - Price Decrease Count M/M	- The percentage change in the price decrease count from the previous month.
 - Price Decrease Count Y/Y	- The percentage change in the price decrease count from the same month in the previous year.
